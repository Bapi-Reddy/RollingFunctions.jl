### works with unweighted data
- data that is a simple vector
- data that is a CartesianIndexed vector

### works with weights
- weights given as a simple vector
- weights given as a kind of StatsBase.AbstractWeights

### works with functions
#### exports prewrapped statistical functions
- rollmin, rollmax, rollmean, rollmedian
- rollvar, rollstd, rollsem, rollmad, rollvariation
#### exports rolling(function, data, windowsize)
- use with your own functions

### examples of use
- with a simple vector
- with a DataFrame column
- with a TimeSeries column
- with your own function

## Tapering

When rolling a window over a finite data sequence, one may prefer
to obtain a result that incorporates just as many elements as has
the source sequence.  The trailing (earliest) values are not fully
coverable by the window's span.  Tapering is one way to accomodate
this situation.  A tapered roll starts with zero or more prepared
values and grows the window from spanning very few to approaching
the analytic span.  The final tapered value uses a window that is
reduced in coverage by one element. The penultimate tapered value
uses a window that is reduced in coverage by two elements, and so.

We support using prepared values to _prime the rolling evaluation_.
Alternatively, one may just copy over the first few (earliest)
observations and begin growing the taper from those values.

```julia
using RollingFunctions, StatsBase
# and any of these or others as you may select:
# CSV, DataFrames, IndexedTables, JuliaDB, TimeSeries 
data = vector_from_datasource( datasource )

rollingfun = geomean
windowspan = 200
num2prep   = 15

taperprep  = [median(data[1:idx]) for idx=1:num2prep]

taper = tapering(rollingfun, data[1:windowspan-1], taperprep)
```
To copy over the first observations and let them serve as the taperprep
```julia
using RollingFunctions, StatsBase
data = vector_from_datasource( datasource )

rollingfun = geomean
windowspan = 200
num2copy   = 15

taper = tapering(rollingfun, data[1:windowspan-1], num2copy)
```
